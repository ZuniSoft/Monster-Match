# What is it?

Poke Crush is match 3 or more game that was written entirely using Swift Playgrounds 4 for the iPad. It has shuffle functionality when you are out of moves.  A level map to show what levels you have finished and which ones you need to finish.  If you quit mid-game and play again later, the game remembers the last level you were on and starts from that point.
